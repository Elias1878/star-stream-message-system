Welcome to the Star Stream Message System.

I like Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint. This system
is a way of me bringing something cool (like the 
Star Stream) into real life. I wanted it to work
completely in the browser so I could use it on
something like my phone. While also letting it
deliver on certain important assistant 
capabilities. An assistant with another side to it.
I also like making games and as I worked on this,
a thought came to me. What if someone made a game
told through audio and physical space? 
well, I am working on it. 

This Star Stream Message System will hopefully 
become way more than an assistant, (though, it
will still have assistant capabilities.)

This is a personal project meant for fun and
games. It runs locally on the browser. It 
utilizes the world around you as means of
storytelling (through audio.)

Some WARNINGs to keep in mind:
- This program uses the microphone for voice
  commands.
- This program uses your location for certain
  things. It will never truly store your
  location. It WILL, however, store the
  location of areas you mark in Local Storage,
  which is on YOUR device.
- This program will use text to speech to keep
  the hands free feel. The only thing you really
  need is a microphone and a way to hear to use
  this system.
- This program MAY use movement and physical
  interaction as part of the experience. E.g.
  dodging, running, jumping. I might also
  provide alternatives for those who don't
  want to move. 
- I am working on making the program as safe as
  possible.

Privacy:
Everything stays on your device:
- No cloud storage 
- No analytics
- No tracking or ads
- Encryption is planned for locally stored data

License / Usage:
You are free to fork, explore, or adapt this system
but please respect its intent:
Keep it personal, fun, private, and safe for anyone
who tries it.
