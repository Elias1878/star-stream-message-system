Welcome to the Star Stream Message System.

I like Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint. This system
is a way of me bringing something cool (like the 
Star Stream) into real life. I wanted it to work
completely in the browser so I could use it on
something like my phone. While also letting it
deliver on certain important assistant 
capabilities. An assistant with another side to it.
I also like making games and as I worked on this,
a thought came to me. What if someone made a game
told through audio and physical space? 
well, I am working on it. 

This Star Stream Message System will hopefully 
become way more than an assistant, (though, it
will still have assistant capabilities.)
